Data visualizations wanted for my talk:

https://shaneslides.com/fossbackstage/WhoFundsFOSSFoundations-FOSSBackstage2024.html#1  for a live talk

Nick has the spreadsheet of data.

# Important concepts to show the audience

- Comparison of relative c3 finances
  - Nice graphs showing annual revenue and total assets for past 5 years for each (one slide at a time)
    - Apache software foundation
    - NumFocus
    - Software Freedom Conservancy
    - Mozilla Foundation
    - Also want to show the averages for all c3s of average revenue, and average assets across 5 years
      - Totals for all c3s
      - Totals for all c3s excluding the outliers: Wikimedia Foundation, Mozilla Foundation (both of which are financial and organizational outliers)

- Comparisons of Total Revenues over 5 years, log scale (compressed); then same graph again, but normal scale (shows Linux foundation as far outlier)
  - Apache Software Foundation
  - NumFocus
  - Software Freedom Conservancy
  - Linux Foundation

- Set of bubble charts, building up a story of revenue and asset disparities for most recent year
  - Bubble showing **average** c3 organization funds in USD: *avg* assets: 6M USD, *avg* revenue 3.5M
  - Add a bubble showing just Mozilla Foundation assets: 75M and revenue: 30M
  - Add a bubble showing just Wikimedia Foundation assets: 231M and revenue: 158M
  - Add a bubble showing totals for **all** c3s minus outliers (Wikimedia, Mozilla, EFF): assets: 76M revenue: 80M

In a different color/column, show c6 asset levels:
  - top 7 c6 organizations, not including LF: assets: 15M, revenue: 24M
