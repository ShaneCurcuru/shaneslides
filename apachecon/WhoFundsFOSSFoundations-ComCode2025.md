- *Finding better questions to ask*

I hope to leave everyone with enough information and ideas, so that you can start asking better questions when you're working on sustainability.
Note: this is US centric data; would love help collating non-US nonprofit data.

Listening sustainability conversations, I'm struck by how siloed they are.  Each participant is coming in with their own needs and their own vocabulary, and it's often hard to find efficient ways to translate one aspect's needs to the vocabulary or taxonomy some other aspect needs.

# Sponsorship Program Modeling

> How do foundations define their sponsorship programs?

> How can we model these programs to gain insight?

???
In researching how foundations are funded, I wanted to see how much income was directly from official sponsorship models, and how those sponsorship models were structured and marketed.  What kinds of benefits do sponsors get, and how much does it cost?

So I built a model and analyzed 30+ foundations or sub-foundations to see the data.  More to come!

template: logorb
# Sponsorship Program Criteria

- Only publicly posted programs
- Not tracking event sponsorships
- Level amounts are approximate
- Tracking ~30 foundations so far

.bottomnote[https://fossfoundation.info/sponsorships]

???
I'm focusing on quantifying how traditional foundation corporate sponsorships are modeled.  All data is drawn from publicly posted sponsorship programs in the past year or so.  This is not including event sponsorships, because those have a different typical structure, and aren't expected to be continuing.

**IMPORTANT:** Numbers are approximate! A number of programs offer sliding scales by numbers of employees or revenue; we track the top end of each level's cost.  Also, we don't know the actual details of sponsorships; some may pay more or less depending on discounts or other factors.

template: logorb
# Sponsorship Program Schema

- Map program levels to *first, second,..., community, etc.*
- Track funding **amount** per level
- Model the **benefits** for levels
  - *Governance* /or/ *Advisory* roles
  - Services or Events discounts
  - Marketing partnerships
- Scrape live CSS or landscape.yml

.bottomnote[https://github.com/Punderthings/fossfoundation/blob/main/_data/sponsorships-schema.json]

???
Most organizations include scraping definitions to automatically parse listings of sponsorship pages; some are manually drawn maps as of a specific date.  Future ideas include using the wayback machine to see historical sponsorship trends, both of foundations, and of sponsors.

**IMPORTANT:** this is only a subset of foundations, mostly depending on which foundations fit the criteria and were easiest to write scrapers for - or had a small enough sponsor list I could manually hardcode it.  This does not represent the whole ecosystem.

???
These calculations are done by multiplying the number of listed sponsors at each level, times the "price" of that sponsorship level in the prospectus.

We can see a good mix of sponsor levels; we also see the ASF has more in-kind donations overall than cash ones.

NumFOCUS has a smaller set of projects and a different focus, but otherwise is a c3 like the ASF that provides various project services.  Here we see a notably smaller number of sponsoring organizations.  Note the actual 1M value there is likely off, because their grant programs aren't assigned specific values.  Anyone know if they publicly disclose those levels of finances?

CNCF, which is a division of the Linux Foundation shows a couple of interesting differences.  First, the sheer number of organizations listed as sponsoring: over 700 total.  Plus, the presumed book value of those sponsorships: 39M (down from 42M just about a year ago).  Note that various funding sponsors may well have different agreements, and also that other sponsors here likely have very little financial expectations vs. corporate sponsors.

.bottomnote[book value? (USD) 33M]

???
The thing I find most surprising at looking at the LF's sponsorship list is that number on the third silver level - well over one thousand companies sponsor the LF at the silver level.  This is partly because many of the LF's sub foundations each require an LF silver membership.  Overall LF sponsor numbers and funding numbers have gone roughly up in the past year.
Also note that the total book value is an approximation: it's clear that there are sponsorship discounts when companies sponsor multiple LF subfoundations.  It's also clear that many software companies sponsor multiple LF subfoundations.

Reminder: sponsorships are only part of the equation.  Depending on the type of foundation and the ecosystem they're in, the amount of sponsorships vs. individual donations vs. "program income" (event tickets, services fees, etc.) varies widely.

This is an excellent holistic overview of how funding typically gets to open source contributors, foundations, and more.  From [Kara Sowles' excellent talk at FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/2024/schedule/event/fosdem-2024-2751-the-state-of-funding-free-open-source-software/) this year.
