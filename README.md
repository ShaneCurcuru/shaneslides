# Shane's Open Source slides

A better place to write and store slide decks for the various open source
conferences that I speak at. Be sure to look for speaker notes!

## Technology

After years of using an office suite to craft slides using a custom template
for every conference, I've switched many presos to using simple Markdown and
one of the modern browser-based JS slide tools.

Using Remark, I usually run a slide deck **locally** (having seen far too 
many conference wifi networks barf).  Open a command terminal, cd 
to the /shaneslides/ directory, and then do:

```ruby -run -ehttpd . -p8000```
or do:
```python -m http.server 8000```

Then open your browser to http://localhost:8000/apachecon (for example)
and click on the .html file for the presentation to run.

## Conferences

I speak regularly at [ApacheCon and
Community Over Code](https://communityovercode.org/) on community and branding issues
around Apache projects. I've also spoken at All Things Open, OSCON, Ignite, Camel One, the Software Freedom Law Conference, and the PLI Law Education conference.

## Historical Note

Code historians may note this site was manually created by copying files from my /slides repository in November 2022.
This is because the DNS verification and publishing of that repo seemed to be totally borked, although I haven't figured out how to reproduce the bug to report to GitHub Pages.
