# Who pays for FOSS Foundations?

What does that actually mean?

- What is **open source**?
- **How do you pay** for it?
- What **things or activities** are paid for?
- How do **Foundations** get funded?

???
Talking with 5 people about "FOSS Funding" gives you 10 different topics to cover, so let's define what we're covering here today.

First off, some brief definitions:

The important question: what are the **different ways to contribute** to open source - code, services, activities, events, sponsorships

Then we'll talk money - how key FOSS Foundations get funded

I expect many of you will end up with more questions to ask after this talk - there are many other areas of "funding" to cover out there, and I'm hoping this overview will make you think a little more about how open source works at scale, especially with larger projects or the many foundations that provide a home to so many important projects out there.

# Most major open source is from companies

???
Here's my belief: most of the major open source projects used today are now primarily built and maintained by companies directly paying their employees to contribute.  Let's see what data from some major projects show.

---

# Linux kernel development

The Linux Kernel Report tracks which companies are sponsoring kernel development.

???
The Linux Kernel Report does a thorough analysis of both who's contributing all the code, as well as who they're working for or being paid by.

_SPACEBAR_

--
- In 2020, at least **83%** of code was *paid corporate work*

--
- 2018 it was 85%
- 2016 it was 80%
- 2015 it was 80%
- 2013 it was 80%
- 2012 it was 75%
- 2010 it was 70%

???
The great majority of work done in the Linux kernel is done directly by corporations (having their employees make the fixes), and this number is only going up over time.

# Apache software committers

Survey: how Apache committers contribute to their projects.

- ~**50%** replied it was as an *Employee (as their job)*
- ~40% replied as an *Individual (outside regular job)*
- ~10% were *Retired, students, other*

.code[https://s.apache.org/2016dsurvey]

???
Let's look at the ASF - which has hundreds of Apache project communities.  In 2016 we ran a survey.

The ASF ran a similar survey this year, which also shows a high percentage of work on our projects is directly paid.

# Drupal commits and sponsors

Drupal regularly updates their contribution reports - in 2021:

- **68%** of code was *Wholly sponsored work*
- 16% was *Work that's a mix or not credited*
- 16% was *Purely volunteer work*

.code[https://dri.es/who-sponsors-drupal-development-2021]

???
Drupals' credit system uses commit logs to show not just who wrote the code, but if the contributor was sponsored or paid to do make that commit by a company or other entity.  That counts either software vendor employees, or consultants or integrators working for end users.

The ratio of sponsored to not sponsored is increasing over time, and my bet is a similar ratio is in most of the widely-used software products in business today.  See details of the program: https://www.drupal.org/drupalorg/contribution-credit

# Services Foundations provide

Foundations provide:

- Governance
- Mentoring
- Legal shield
- Fundraising
- Hosting, build pipelines, clouds
- Respectability / brand management
- Events
- Community education / management
- Marketing / ecosystem development

???
We still rely on many volunteers to help, but when it comes to reviewing contracts or doing the accounting on donations, we need hired help.  Accounting volunteers are rare to find in the coding world, and few coders want to carry a beeper for 24x7 support when the server goes down.  All these services we need money for.

All of these services are hard to provide at scale with volunteers - so Foundations are needed to provide the fiscal organization to pay someone to provide them.

# Comparative Review: Foundation Services & Funding

???
Non-profit foundations attract some donations - from individuals or small businesses who want to say thanks for the software we provide.  But the bulk of funding for most software non-profits comes from corporate grants or recurring sponsors.

How do these foundations get their money?  Primarily recurring corporate sponsorships.

Let's review some key FOSS Foundations, and how they're funded.

.bottomnote[Conservancy is a **501C3** Public Charity]

???
Conservancy lists their major sponsors, along with a number of smaller, individual sponsors.  Conservancy doesn't list sponsorship amounts, but my bet is that the above sponsors provide the bulk of Conservancy's annual income.

???
On the left, we see Conservancy's annual gross income for the past few years, primarily from donations.  Conservancy's income is on a steady upward trend, surpassing $4M in 2021, the last year that official IRS 990 forms are available for.

On the right, we can see Conservancy's Net Assets - cash in the bank or investments for their continuing operations, which also has a solid upwards trend surpassing $6M in 2021.

.bottomnote[ASF is a **501C3** Public Charity]

???
Those are just the platinum sponsors, but they represent about $800K in annual donations, or about half the financial income for the entire ASF.  These sponsors get a thank you and a listing on our webpage, but otherwise have no influence over how the ASF or Apache projects are run.

Thank you to all the ASF sponsors, Gold, Silver, Bronze, and in-kind sponsors too as well as all our ApacheCon event sponsors!

# Apache - In-Kind Sponsors

Apache's Targeted *(In-Kind/Services)* Platinum sponsors are:

- AWS
- Gradle
]

.bottomnote[ASF is a **501C3** Public Charity]

???
There are more ways to organizationally support Apache than just donating cash.  Each of these organizations is a Targeted Platinum sponsor, meaning they donate the equivalent of a Platinum sponsorship of hosting services, bandwidth, cloud credits, and CI pipelines or testing resources to Apache projects.

Importantly, these are all services that Apache projects directly need and are actually using.

???
Here we can see the ASF's income and assets - an average of about $1million annual income, with the singular blip of the Pineapple fund one-time donation in 2017.  More projects and more services that Conservancy, but slightly smaller funding numbers.

Note that all numbers here are taken directly from the 990 tax forms that all US charities file with the IRS.

]

???
NumFocus shows a roughly similar funding picture as the previous foundations.  There are likely differences in the ways NumFocus is funded given their strong focus on scientific and research projects - meaning both different types of corporations interested, as well as much more of an opportunity for grants.

]

???
Here we can see the Eclipse's income and assets - averaging well about $5million or more in annual income.  Since much of their income is tied to corporations that are also major sponsors, their income may tend to be more even than donation-focused organizations.

Note that Eclipse has moved their governance to Belgium, meaning that we can't necessarily compare all of their numbers to other fully US-based organizations.

The Cloud Native Computing Foundation is a subsidiary of the Linux Foundation, and just for the CNCF, they have this list of platinum sponsors, each of which are donating in the range of 250K or more annually to the CNCF.

These are just sponsoring the CNCF, and likely represents at least **4M in annual income**, if not more, for the CNCF and Linux Foundation.

# Who Sponsors The Linux Foundation?

... and the 200+ Collaborative Projects at the LF?

**Answer:** A lot of companies, many repeatedly.

???
There are probably a dozen **major** collaborative projects, each with their own sponsors (and products), and another hundred plus or so smaller projects - still interesting, but with fewer or little direct funding.

In particular, you'll note there are many software vendors - and non-software companies! - who are sponsoring multiple projects at the LF with cash as well as contributions.

---
template: logorb
# Linux Foundation - Funding

.left-column-equal[

.right-column-equal[
<img src="img/linux-assets-2023.png" style="width: 95%" />
]

???
Here we can see the LF's income and assets.  Huh.  Those are pretty big numbers - these charts are an order of magnitude higher than the earlier charts.  In 2021, LF made $140 million in income, and listed net assets of $89 million.

Anyone surprised at these numbers?  Remember: these figures are from 2018, the most year IRS 990 forms are available for.  As a Business League, the LF doesn't otherwise provide public budget figures, so we don't know what their 2019 income was, or what the blip in their net assets over 2017 was.

---
template: logorb
# Governance, Funding, And Community All Matter

Community and governance matters too, beyond funding or license.

???
Wow - I bet those funding numbers are giving you something to think about going forward, huh?  These four foundations - along with several others - provide valuable fiscal and community hosting to a large percentage of interesting open source projects in the world today.  And remember: actual contributions and community governance are often more important long-term than just cash funding.

When you bring a new project to the ASF or to another foundation, you're making a fundamental choice about more than the license.  You're setting the stage for how the project is going to grow, who's going to want to contribute to it, and where it's long-term direction can end up.  Funding and governance are more important than the license choice.

In particular, funding is not required to get FOSS Foundation services - but in some cases, more funding does get you more concentrated help from open source experts.  The large cash differences in the charts earlier are definitely related to the amount of services different foundations can directly provide to their flagship projects.

# What Ways Do Companies Contribute?

- Obvious: employees contributing code
- Obvious: sponsoring events
- Not obvious: infrastructure, tooling

There's a lot of talk about how much - or how little - money various companies and vendors pay into the open source arena.  But the discussions about money are missing a huge factor: what are all the **different ways** that Companies contribute work back to FOSS projects?

It's often not obvious to quantify some of the supporting ways that companies contribute, but they're certainly there.  Managing a full open source project needs source control, web space, continuous integration and testing, and often requires access to cloud services.  Either directly or indirectly many software vendors like github, amazon, google and more all effectively donate these kinds of services to projects.  Sometimes it's explicit and called out, often it's simply free accounts for any open source contributor

But the real value is in how much corporate employees contribute work to FOSS projects - code, documentation, tests, and more.  

While many individual developers may feel unappreciated for their volunteer work, that's only a small part of the overall patches and code that is put into open source projects.  It depends on the kind and size of project, but in some areas the majority of work is done by employees at software vendors writing open source code as their dayjob.
