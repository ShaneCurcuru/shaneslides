The ASF Way - Effective Open Source Project Management
</div>

### Abstract

The Apache Way is useful for organizations and individuals to be more 
effective at working in distributed communities.  Open source software does not 
necessarily mean open development - and true community-led open development 
is where the fun starts in working in FOSS!

There are a lot more aspects to consider and areas to invest in as 
you move forward through the open source journey.  These are just the 
starting points to work on.

Key updates this year is a section on Charity - fundamental to the ASF's non-profit mission, plus a pragmatic part of our method in ensuring maximum inbound contributions, as 
well as updated slide notes and more links between the behavior and the why.

Remember: these slides are open source - I'd love your patches, as well as 
questions or ideas of how to better explain the relationship between these 
behaviors and how Apache projects document themselves in real life.
