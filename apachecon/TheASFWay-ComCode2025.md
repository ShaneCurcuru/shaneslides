# What Is The Apache Way?

> The Apache Way is a set of **collective behaviors**.

.bottomnote[https://www.apache.org/theapacheway/]

???
High level intro: the Way is a set of general behaviors that focus on how communities of people can work together.

These aren't hard and fast rules; there's no magic way to follow the way.  These are behaviors that the whole community should adapt and model over time to really see the benefits.

---
template: logorb
# Why Follow The Apache Way?

> The Apache Way is designed to promote:

- **long-lived** projects
- serving the **public good**
- **community-led governance**
- welcoming **new contributors**
- maintaining **vendor neutrality**

> These behaviors are expected in ASF projects.

.bottomnote[https://www.apache.org/theapacheway/]

???
High level intro, mention concepts: community, openness, merit, consensus.  Purpose is for long-lived projects run collaboratively.

These behaviors *can* serve any open community interested in longevity.  They are not necessarily optimized for speed of development or any particular technical strategy; rather they are optimized for building and maintaining dispersed communities of collaboration.

# Community

# Community

- What do we mean by *community* here?
  - We don't live together
  - We don't work together
  - We don't know each other
- Except *through this project*

.topnote[new contributors]

???
What does community mean here?  Working on an independent open source
project is very different than most other human activities.  There are
no other ties between project contributors who are widely distributed
in location, in time, in experience, and in jobs outside our project itself.
**SPACEBAR**

--

- Community includes developers, writers, testers, sysadmins,
devops, marketing, conferences... **and users**.

.bottomnote[https://theapacheway.com/community/]

???
We should focus on an entire project community - all of us working to
create or improve this specific projects in some way, **and** all the 
end users who come by with questions or bugs or improvements.
The important thing is that the **community** owns our project.  Not you,
not me, not your company.  All of us, together.

Having a shared sense of communal ownership keeps the work aligned in ways
that make it clear users with fixes or new ideas will be accepted, and 
they might become a committer or PMC member with binding input in a
project someday.  Also: while contributors may be on other
projects as well, many participants will only know you from one project.

---
template: logorb
# Wear Your Hats

- You are an individual here - not an employee
- All participation is by individuals - not companies

- **Individuals** get recognition
  - Side effect for corporate teams: each employee participates separately
  - Side effect for **you**: your merit stays with **you** across jobs

.bottomnote[https://theapacheway.com/hats/]
.topnote[vendor neutral]

???
The ASF does not allow direct corporate participation in projects.  
The ASF recognizes individual contributions.  Merit accrues to individuals, and they
are expected to act appropriately within each project community as
an individual, not as an employee.

"Wearing your hat" may be a polite fiction - many employment agreements require
putting employer interests first - but it's a key part of Apache projects.

This ensures that newcomers - from big employers or small ones - are
welcome in our projects, and also means that the merit **you** gain
in an Apache project stays with **you**, no matter where you work.  That
helps encourage long-lived participants, across jobs, and allows
those with deep expertise in Apache projects a better chance to continue
their contribution over time.

---
template: logorb
# Check Job Titles At The Door

- Job titles don't apply in projects
- No hierarchy in community
- Projects don't have hierarchy
  - Each project is separate
  - Each PMC member gets one vote
  
> "It's not a hierarchy, it's a community"

.bottomnote[https://theapacheway.com/individuals/]
.topnote[community-led governance]

???
Wearing your project hat means you're acting on behalf of the project as
a whole, not your employer.  Sometimes you need to do things as an
employee; that's fine.  But mark it clearly, and when voting on
serious project decisions, wear your project hat.

Yes - this sometimes means as an employee, you may be collaborating
on a specific project technology with employees of your corporate
competitors.  This is fine - in fact, it's part of why Apache is
called the Switzerland of open source; we are the **vendor-neutral** place
were everyone can work together on specific technologies.

In any case: please do thank your employer (when appropriate) for 
giving you time to contribute back to ASF projects!

---
template: logorb
# Independent Governance

- PMCs are community-led governance
  - ASF projects are **vendor-neutral**
- ASF owns the trademarks
  - ASF board ensures neutrality

.bottomnote[https://community.apache.org/projectIndependence.html]
.topnote[long-lived projects]

???
The net effect of all the above is that projects are governed for the
public good and the best interests of the project community as a whole.

PMCs are expected to make releases and vote in new committers based on
how many positive contributions individuals make in the project, not 
on their employer or background.

When PMCs slack in their duties, the board is here to provide oversight
and if necessary, correction.  Both at the PMC level and the board level
we expect people to act for the public good - and the fact we are a
501C3 organization, with directors elected from merit - not sponsor
dollars - means we can back it up.

It's rare, but the board can and will step in if a commercial company
is abusing their influence within an Apache project; we also have 
a Vice President of Brand Management who addresses trademark issues.

# What YOU Have Done

The contributions **you** have brought to the specific project, as defined
in the **context of that project** by that community.

> "You gain merit by doing things the community values"

.bottomnote[https://theapacheway.com/merit/]
.topnote[community-led governance]

???
Merit at the ASF is often misunderstood, and perhaps (in retrospect)
it wasn't the best term to choose.  But the meaning here is specific, and 
is focused on actual project contributions, not employment, background,
or other personal characteristics.

Your merit is the value you bring to a project **as judged by that project's community**.

Every project is its own merit structure.  Merit is not transferable,
and it doesn't expire.  It may get stale through inactivity, but it
stays with you through jobs and careers.  If you come back to a project
after being away, you'll still be a committer.

---
template: logorb
# Growing Your Scope

The more you do, the more power *you may be granted* to take actions:

- User
- Contributor
- **Committer**
- **PMC Member**
- PMC Chair / VP
- **ASF Member**
- **Director**

.bottomnote[https://community.apache.org/contributor-ladder.html]
.topnote[long-lived projects]

???
Each step is defined by the merit you are recognized for by that
specific community. Each step means you can get a vote on new tasks, 
in the context of that community.

The key steps are being a committer - changing code yourself - and being
a PMC member - voting on releases or new committers on **that** project.  
Most of the other levels are about visibility and having a say, but not
necessarily having a deciding vote.

In particular, Project VPs / Chairs of their PMC don't have any extra votes;
their duties are really about communicating issues to the board.  At the 
Membership level, you have a say in the *Foundation*, but not the projects.

---
template: logorb
# Merit is Not Authority

## *Leaders* versus Managers

> "Merit grants **privileges** - commit, binding votes"

> "Merit is not **authority** - community makes decision"

.topnote[community-led governance]

???
You are still part of the community - it's not a hierarchy; everyone
with merit (commit bit) has a chance to influence the consensus
in most project decisions equally.

Everyone can propose and commit new work.  Just because you don't find it
valuable, doesn't mean some other part of the community can't think it's
valuable to them.  Merit is about the ability to do new things, not
really about stopping the rest of the community from their new work.

Enough merit in a project can gain you **Respect** in the community.
People will listen to you because they respect and trust your judgement,
not because you have authority in the project.

---
template: logorb
# Anti-pattern: Umbrella projects

Apache Jakarta *was* an umbrella project: many different sub-projects and
communities, with different technologies.

PMCs should be coherent communities to equitably recognize merit.

???
A cautionary tale: in the past, we have had successful projects that grew
in scope - both technical and social - until they were too big to
govern themselves effectively.

When a project grows such that different groups of committers running
sub-projects can't evaluate each other's work or use different governance 
processes to manage sub-projects, then it's probably too big.

Everyone doesn't need to directly work on each sub-project, or be an expert 
there - but you do need to have enough broad community members paying 
attention, so that the PMC could reliably detect issues (or make security 
releases) if something happens in any sub-project.

# Time Shifted Communications

- Asynchronous communication enables:
  - Dispersed communities:
  - ...dispersed in location / culture
  - ...dispersed in abilities / expertise
  - ...dispersed in **time**
- Our only connection: this project

.topnote[new contributors]

???
Remember: we are a dispersed community, each with our own lives and jobs.
We need to show the work we're doing - and allow feedback - in whatever
timeframe works for everyone else on the project.

You don't need to wait for **everyone's** feedback - but do recognize that
sometimes other committers will have better ideas, or will be willing
to do some of the work for you.  That's why formal decisions in Apache
projects always have a minimum amount of time that must pass before
getting finalized.

---
template: logorb
# Archiving Everything

> If It Didn't Happen On-List It Didn't Happen

- Archived and searchable history enables:
  - feedback
  - critique
  - new ideas
  - others to show their work
- Public archives are the default

.bottomnote[https://theapacheway.com/on-list/]
.topnote[long-lived projects]

???
Note: while the ASF currently relies on mailing lists, we are actively 
adapting this lesson to other technologies like slack, discord, wechat.

What this means is: if it didn't happen in a space managed by the 
project, that is archived in a well-known place, and easily searchable, 
then it didn't happen.

Archiving **everything** means that newcomers can get up to speed with
all the information of the project available for them in an easy to
share and search way - this helps newcomers understand where the project 
is going, and see how the community interacts with each other.  Archives are 
also valuable for long-term cohesion, because when repeat questions come 
up, we can see our past decision - and the discussion that led to it.

You should default to using a public list - like dev@ or user@ - for
almost everything.  There are only a few things, like security bugs
or personnel matters - that should be done on private lists.

Archiving things is just another way to enable long-term time-shifting.

# Make Transparent Decisions

- Motives usually external to the community
  - How does a decision benefit **the project**?
- Engage community at all steps:
  - Telegraph your intent
  - Draft designs openly
  - Submit work in chunks
  - Always seek feedback

.bottomnote[https://theapacheway.com/open/]
.topnote[new contributors]

???
Ensuring decisions are made openly - when everyone has the same information
and time to read it - is required of Apache projects.'s required.  

- Telegraph your intent: email dev@ with your *ideas* ahead of time.  This allows feedback, encouragement, someone else to point out similar code is already over there, etc.
- Draft designs openly.  Put the rough first draft on the wiki/website/dev@ list, and then do your edits *in public*.  This allows feedback on the architecture as it's being built, and again, gets better ideas.  It also allows a sense of community ownership.
- Submit work in chunks (add: on a regular and frequent basis).  Checkin the shell of the API.  Then checkin each section of implementation.  If you're waiting for your code to look perfect before showing anyone else, you're not really helping the community.  Doing the development in the open allows for... you guessed it, feedback.
- Welcome feedback along the way.  This doesn't mean you need to accept every change request or suggestion.  But it does mean you can take the best ideas from the whole community to add them easily, as the individual bits of work are being done.

# Long-term Stewardship

- Apache License v2.0
  - Maximum user freedom
- Trust in ASF as organization
  - To maintain open development
  - To continue to provide source code

> Apache Attic - where quiet projects slumber *forever*

.bottomnote[https://theapacheway.com/pragmatic/]
.topnote[long-lived projects]

???
A goal of the ASF is to encourage maximum inbound contributions.
Using the broadly permissive Apache License v2.0 is a key part of
this - both from the legal details point of view, and as an
important and enduring part of the Apache brand.

People trust they can just use stuff from Apache without being surprised
by any unusual licenses or changes.  They also trust that Apache will
be around in 10 years to provide access to the source code.  The Apache
Attic is here to maintain *every* codebase we've ever shipped, to be
available read-only as long as the ASF itself is around.

# Decision Making

[Take a different way?](#menu) | Continue Onward?

template: logorb
# Consensus Preferred

- Consensus within community
- Choose **a** good path forward
  - Improve something; don't regress
  - Community values different things

.bottomnote[https://theapacheway.com/consensus/]
.topnote[community-led governance]

???
**There is no perfection** - just getting better step by step.  Our goal is
to serve the public good, so any new features - as long as they don't
fail the tests or unduly slow down performance - are a good thing.

Consensus doesn't mean everyone thinks it's perfect - just that any
proposed change is better somehow than we have now.

Building a true consensus is important for major changes.  But for
minor changes, going for "Lazy consensus" is fine: providing
an opportunity for people to object; if no one does, go ahead.

---
template: logorb
# Votes When Needed

> "Voting records an **official** consensus"

> "Voting is a shortcut - when required"

.bottomnote[https://community.apache.org/committers/decisionMaking.html]
.topnote[community-led governance]

???
**Here are two quotes about voting** - the +1/-1 you've all heard about.
One of these is a good use of voting, the other is... necessary.

You must vote on releases.  In some cases, the vote is the formal
record that a PMC or the board made a decision.  That keeps the decision
an act of the ASF as a foundation, and not just a bunch of
individual developers.  Votes are also normally used on new committers/PMC.

Voting to speed consensus... it can be OK in some cases, but where possilbe
we prefer to work through to a better consensus. Some projects choose as
a whole community to use votes more often, if that works for them.  As
long as the decision process allows the whole project community to
have their input, the use of votes or full consensus is up to the project.

---
template: logorb
# Timeline For Decisions

- **Minimum** time for decisions: 72 hours
- Allows time-shifted community input

.topnote[community-led governance]

???
Your project community is from around the world, and from all sorts of
backgrounds.  For example, some people commit during a dayjob; some people
only have time on weekends or when the kids are asleep.

Ensuring sufficient time for most community members to comment is
required for major decisions in Apache projects.

One exception is for security issues: serious security breaches can
be fixed as soon as possible, to help ensure our users aren't harmed.

---
template: logorb
# No External Deadlines

Because **we** don't have any - unless **we** agree on them *together*

.topnote[long-lived projects]

???
The ASF relies on volunteers (from the Apache perspective) to do our
work.  Therefore in project areas, we don't have deadlines, other
then ones the project defines as a community.  Working towards a
project roadmap is a great way to encourage users and contributors -
but if the project slips deadlines, that's just fine.

Remember: security issues often do have deadlines.

# Communication

template: logorb
# Be Kind

**Be kind.**

Everyone is a **volunteer** here.

.topnote[new contributors]

???
Remember: everyone else in the community **here at Apache** is a
volunteer.  Being kind in your words and tone, and respecting everyone
else's input (even if you disagree) and especially respecting everyone
else's **time** that they volunteer for your project is important.

We can and do often have serious disagreements.  But doing so with
communication styles that are kind and respectful is critical for
the long term health of any project - or even just to get other
project participants to vote or help with your ideas.

---
template: logorb
# Netiquette

**Ask smart questions**

Make it easy for communities to answer your question.

.bottomnote[https://infra.apache.org/contributors]
.topnote[new contributors]

???
Netiquette.  Smart questions.  Reproduceable bug reports.  Clearly
communicating the what, why, and how of your request.

Asking smart questions means respecting the time of all the other volunteers
reading your email - and ensures that they know what action you're requesting
(bugfix, information, project suggestion) quickly and easily just from
what you wrote.

# Codes of Conduct

Don't be a jerk; avoid the poisonous people...
  and *help* the community do something about it.

**ASF Code of Conduct**
**Updates coming soon 2025**

https://www.apache.org/foundation/policies/conduct

.topnote[new contributors]

???
The ASF has a Foundation-wide code of conduct that is required
behavior in all Apache project and foundation spaces.  NOTE: The Board is 
likely adopting a new, more detailed code of conduct this winter.

The intent of the Code of Conduct is not to be a hammer; it's meant to
be a framework we can use to help both individuals and whole communities
to see the expected standards of discourse we want on Apache lists.

# Language

> "Core **development** activity must be in English."

- Translation software isn't social
- The whole community must be able to evaluate your work
- The board provides oversight to **all** communities

.topnote[community-led governance]

???
At the current time, it's only practical for the ASF to provide
governance and hosting to communities that can operate their primary
dev@ list in English.  

This doesn't mean it can't be done - it certainly is being done in China
and elsewhere - just that the ASF can't support non-english as the
primary **project planning** language.  User support, translation, outside
evangelist work can be in any language, as long as you can report the
status of your work periodically to the project in English.

The ASF is a public charity, and our mission is explicitly to produce software that
is useful, and always free of cost or restrictions for people to use.  
Alongside the permissive Apache license itself, the ASF's policies around 
acceptable software that our projects can contain is focused on ensuring that 
users don't find any surprising restrictions in any of our products.

While our pragmatic licensing focuses on the legal enablement of open source, so
that everyone can contribute, many ASF committers also have some form of
altruism guiding their work - enjoying building things for free to give away.

Our pragmatic and permissive license is designed with no surprises, and

it allows the maximum number of contributors, because people or organizations 
with any sort of business model or otherwise can contribute without 
any impact to their goals outside the project.
